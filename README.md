# Radar Application

This video demonstrates the operation of the **"Radar"** application. Using the API, you can adjust various parameters such as:  
- **Measurements Per Rotation**  
- **Rotation Speed**  
- **Target Speed**  

On the right side of the interface, you can observe the **signal power level**, which determines the color of the point based on the signal's strength.
